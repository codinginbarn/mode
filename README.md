# Mode

Mode is the first client-only AI coding companion for Visual Studio Code, delivering secure, fast, and direct access to your preferred language models (LLMs) without relying on third-party servers. Mode offers a streamlined experience for enhancing productivity, improving code quality, and facilitating smoother code review and debugging processes.

## Why Choose Mode?

- **True Privacy**: Mode connects directly to your chosen LLM provider, ensuring that your code and interactions never pass through an intermediary. This gives you complete control over your data—no extra permissions or compliance checks needed at work.
- **Direct Connection to LLMs**: By connecting directly to model providers, Mode gives you immediate access to the latest updates from providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Mistral, and Cohere, ensuring you’re always working with the most advanced versions available. With this direct setup, you won’t experience third-party throttling or extra costs for upgraded tokens or “fast-lane” access. This allows you to fully leverage each provider's performance and responsiveness without interruptions or hidden fees.
- **Built for Enterprise and Flexibility**: Mode puts more control in developers' hands by enabling prompt and temperature customization, along with the freedom to add any preferred models. With Mode, enterprise developers can bring their own API keys, making it easy to integrate directly with the LLM providers already approved in their organization. By eliminating third-party backends, Mode also simplifies deployment in security-sensitive environments where data privacy and control are paramount. This "bring your own keys" approach empowers developers to fine-tune Mode’s responses and functionality to fit specific project needs, ensuring the AI aligns with team goals and coding standards.
