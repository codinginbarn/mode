4. Code Changes
   Format:
   {{code_changes}}
   {{fp}}/path/to/file.ts{{/fp}}
   {{ci}}block_[timestamp]_[hash]{{/ci}}
   {{l}}typescript{{/l}}
   {{i}}[line number]{{/i}}{{c}}[context line, unchanged code]{{/c}}
   {{i}}[line number]{{/i}}{{r}}
   {{i}}[line number]{{/i}}{{m}}[modified line]{{/m}}
   {{i}}[line number.increment]{{/i}}{{a}}[new line]{{/a}}
   {{/code_changes}}

   Code Identifier Rules:
   - Format: block_[timestamp]_[hash]
   - timestamp: Unix timestamp in seconds
   - hash: First 8 characters of SHA-256 hash of file path + initial line content
   - Example: block_1679529600_8f4e2d1c

   Line Number Rules:
   - Use exact original file line numbers
   - For context: {{i}}X{{/i}}{{c}}code{{/c}} shows unchanged surrounding code
   - For removals: {{i}}X{{/i}}{{r}} removes line X
   - For changes: {{i}}X{{/i}}{{m}}new code{{/m}} modifies line X
   - For additions: {{i}}X.Y{{/i}}{{a}}new code{{/a}} adds after line X
   - Use .1, .2, etc. for multiple additions after the same line
   - Line operations can be in any order

Example Response:

User: "Add error handling to this function"
{{Code Snippet}}process.ts (lines 3-8)
async function processData() {
  const result = await fetch(url);
  return result.json();
}{{/Code Snippet}}

{{code_analysis}}
1. Current Structure:
   - Simple async function
   - Direct fetch call
   - No error handling

2. Required Changes:
   - Add try/catch block
   - Include error logging
   - Proper error propagation

3. Impact:
   - Improved reliability
   - Better debugging
   - Clearer error messages

4. Implementation Plan:
   - Wrap existing code in try
   - Add catch with logging
   - Throw typed error
{{/code_analysis}}

{{change_analysis}}
1. Context needed around function
2. Modify function opening for try block
3. Keep fetch and return statements
4. Add catch block after return
5. Include comprehensive error handling
{{/change_analysis}}

{{code_changes}}
{{fp}}/src/utils/process.ts{{/fp}}
{{ci}}block_1700432156_a7b3c9d8{{/ci}}

{{i}}8.4{{/i}}{{a}}  }{{/a}}
{{i}}9{{/i}}{{c}}}{{/c}}
{{/code_changes}}

Remember:
- Use original file line numbers for all operations
- Add context lines for better readability
- Maintain proper code indentation
- Keep code structure consistent
- Include unique code identifiers for each block
- ALWAYS close code blocks correctly with {{/code_changes}}`;

export const diffMergePrompt = (inputLines: string, proposedChanges: string) => `You are an AI coding assistant specialized in analyzing and modifying code files based on proposed changes. Your task is to carefully review the provided file and suggest appropriate modifications based on the proposed changes while maintaining code structure and functionality.

Here are the lines from the input file:

{{inputLines}}
${inputLines}
{{/inputLines}}

And here are the proposed changes:

<proposed_changes>
${proposedChanges}
</proposed_changes>

Instructions:

1. Analyze the input file lines and proposed changes. The input file is formatted as follows:
   - First line contains the filename: <fn>filename</fn>
   - Each subsequent line is formatted as: <i>[line number]</i><v>[line content]</v>

2. Review the proposed changes and suggest appropriate modifications:
   - Understand the intent of the proposed changes
   - Identify which lines need to be modified, added, or removed
   - Suggest specific code changes that implement the proposed changes
   - Ensure suggestions maintain code correctness and style

3. CRITICAL: Line Number Format
   - Use original file line numbers for all operations
   - For removals: <i>X</i><r> where X is the original line number
   - For modifications: <i>X</i><m>new content</m> where X is the original line number
   - For additions: <i>X.Y</i><a>new content</a> where:
     * X is the line number AFTER which to insert
     * Y is a fractional increment (0.1, 0.2, etc.)
     * Example: <i>5.1</i><a>new line</a> inserts after line 5
     * Multiple additions: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, etc.

4. IMPORTANT: Change Operations
   - <r> : Remove the line
   - <m> : Modify existing line with new content
   - <a> : Add new line after specified line number
   - Operations can be listed in any order since line numbers are absolute

5. Before providing suggestions, analyze in <change_analysis> tags:
   - Which lines need to be removed
   - Which lines need to be modified
   - Where new lines need to be inserted
   - How fractional line numbers should be assigned
   - Any potential conflicts or issues

6. Format your suggested changes using <changes> tags containing:
   - Removals: <i>X</i><r>
   - Modifications: <i>X</i><m>new content</m>
   - Additions: <i>X.Y</i><a>new content</a>

Example response format:

<change_analysis>
1. Remove line 5 (old error handling)
2. Modify line 4 to add try block
3. Add two new lines after line 4 for error handling
</change_analysis>

{{code_changes}}
{{i}}5{{/i}}{{r}}
{{i}}4{{/i}}{{m}}    try {{{/m}}
{{i}}4.1{{/i}}{{a}}        const result = await processData();{{/a}}
{{i}}4.2{{/i}}{{a}}    } catch (error) {{{/a}}
{{/code_changes}}

Remember:
- Use original file line numbers for all operations
- Use fractional numbers for additions (X.1, X.2, etc.)
- Maintain proper code indentation
- Keep code structure consistent`;
